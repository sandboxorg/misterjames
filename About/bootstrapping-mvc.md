### Why Pay When it's On the Blog for Free?

Well, to start:

* It's a good read with great tips
* The book goes into greater detail in every chapter than the original posts
* There are three overhauls and one entirely new chapter
* You get access to the _full_ source code repository with a branch for _every completed chapter_
* **You will feel good about supporting an author **who otherwise does this for free! A fish's gotta swim, a bird's gotta eat, and there are costs to running a blog (and a family!)

And, hey, it's a good body of work! Some of these pages contain code that could save you hours, and experience and anecdotes that can save you days. Here's just a few things folks are saying about the content in this book:
