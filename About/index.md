I have had the wonderful experience of working with some incredible people throughout the course of my career. At many points along the way I've leaned on co-workers, and at other times I've been fortunate enough to be leaned on.  It's great to be part of a mentoring relationship as the learning always goes both ways.  You have to stop and count your blessings when you have the opportunity to work with some of the industry's best.

If you're looking for help on a project, training, or to help get your team on track, please also consider [hiring me][1] to make the hard stuff easier! Here's a collection of some of the things that those wonderful folks have had to say about me in return.

James has imparted onto me great advice and insight which helped me to fast track my career goals and my position as a community leader. Last year I earned my Microsoft MVP, an award that I felt which was out of my reach, but I achieved thanks to James' encouragement and support. [Lori Lalonde][2]

James was a pleasure to work with, the guy is outstanding. He's got the dev skills, problem solving, and the imagination to make him valuable on any team. [Stephen Verstraete][3]

James brought new tools and technologies in to use and was very good at transferring his knowledge and excitement for them onto other team members. [Scott Morris][4]

It was a pleasure to work with James. I admire his ability to take business requirements and translate them into robust technology solutions. His technology skills and programming abilities are top-notch, but what sets James apart from the rest is his people skills and his work ethic. [Janelle Torgerson][5]

It seemed like if there was a question to be asked, James had a good answer. It was as if he was Stack Overflow but as a person. [Saleng Xiong][6]

He was a great team player and lead the team to the successful completion of our project. He was knowledgeable, adaptive, a great mentor and very skilled. Would highly recommend him to be a part of my team anytime. [Kwan Fu Sit][7]

James is a passionate and experienced software developer driven by quality code and an exceptional sense of teamwork. He was a delight to work with. [Flavio Gomes][8]

James stays current with many new technologies and projects. He consistently writes high-quality, readable, well tested code. James interfaces very well with coworkers and clients. I am never let down when we pair up to work on a project. [Joel Burgess][9]

Programming is definitely his passion in life, and it's great that he made his career out of his passion. [Dave Stephens][10]

James has a love of technology and programming that radiates out to those who are in his presence. I have had the chance to work with him on a variety of projects and from each one I came away with a greater understanding and thirst to learn more. [Scott Morris][4]

He communicates ideas clearly, and is willing to sit down with you until everyone is on the same page. He strives to deliver the best solutions possible, and excels at addressing stakeholders concerns, including his own teams, and managing expectations. [Janelle Torgerson][5]

James is always willing to take the time to help others achieve their true potential, whether it's providing insight, encouragement, or putting them in touch with the right person. From our first meeting 3 years ago until today, he still puts forth the same energy and enthusiasm to helping others achieve their goals. It's been extremely inspiring to witness that.  [Lori Lalonde][2]

James is a very gifted developer with a contagious enthusiasm for work and everything else in life. [Rob Jackson][11]

James is a creative and original thinker. He has native intelligence, great curiosity about people and ideas, and plenty of common sense. In addition, he has demonstrated excellent powers of observation, and an ability to communicate and suggest change in a very effective way. [Mirela Balan][12]

I consider James my mentor. He provided fair criticism when I made mistakes and acknowledged my successes â€“ all of which helped me grow as a software developer. It was a pleasure working with James and consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with him. I would not hesitate to work with him again. [Janelle Torgerson][5]

He is excellent at understanding a problem and finding a novel solution that will go above and beyond expectations. Even after James move on from the project, the code bases were easy to work with and the team had clear direction of what to do. [Scott Morris][4]
